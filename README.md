# ETL_Using_SSIS
I Finished Five different projects relied on the use of SQL Server Integration Server (SSIS) as ETL Tool.
I concerned on it to achieve the ETL Concept.
I concernced in Designing SSIS Package using DataBase as source and Destination 
and as a destination also i used DWH and new Delimited file (TXT file and CSV).

I used some tasks like:
- Data flow task
- Excute SQL Task
- Backup Data Base  Task
- Script Task (To display an Error message at failure)

I used in Data Flow Task some criteria like:
- Merge Component
- Sort
- Character Map Component
- Conditional Split
- Derived Column Component
